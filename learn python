# STUDY DRILLS FOR "A GOOD FIRST PROGRAM"

# MAKE YOUR SCRIPT PRINT ANOTHER LINE
print ("This is getting boring")
# MAKE YOUR SCRIPT PRINT ONLY ONE OF THE LINES
print ("Hello World!")
#print ("Hello Again")
#print ("I like typing this.")
#print ("This is fun.")
#print ('Yay! Printing.')

# COMMENTS AND POUND CHARACTERS

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print ("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print ("This will run.")

# NUMBERS AND MATH
